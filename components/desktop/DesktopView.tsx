/**
 * The DesktopView component provides a classic desktop environment layout,
 * complete with a dock, a main area for windowed applications, and a taskbar.
 * It is a presentation-only component that consumes state and logic from the
 * WorkspaceContext. This allows it to be used as a pluggable layout within
 * a larger WorkspaceManager system, which might also support layouts like
 * 'Tiled' or 'Tabbed' modes.
 *
 * @component
 * @returns {React.ReactElement} The rendered desktop view.
 *
 * @example
 * // Used within a WorkspaceProvider that provides the necessary context.
 * <WorkspaceProvider>
 *   <DesktopView />
 * </WorkspaceProvider>
 *
 * @performance
 * This component is optimized for rendering performance. It receives already-computed
 * lists of open and minimized windows from the `useWorkspace` hook, preventing
 * unnecessary state calculations or filtering within the view layer. The `Window`
 * components are expected to be memoized and handle their own internal rendering logic,
 * including the lazy loading of micro-frontend applications.
 *
 * @security
 * This component does not handle any sensitive data directly. It serves as a layout
 * shell. All application content is rendered within sandboxed `Window` components which
 * are responsible for loading and displaying micro-frontends. The security of the
 * loaded applications is managed by the MicroFrontend loader and the WindowingSystem
 * composite UI component, which should enforce isolation.
