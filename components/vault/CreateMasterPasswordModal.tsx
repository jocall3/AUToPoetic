/**
 * @file This file is intentionally left empty. The CreateMasterPasswordModal component has been deprecated and removed.
 * @module components/vault/CreateMasterPasswordModal
 * @description As per the architectural directive for a Zero-Trust Security Model, all client-side credential and secret management,
 * including the use of a master password and a local vault, has been eliminated.
 * The new model relies on a server-side Auth Gateway for all secret management.
 * This component is therefore obsolete and has been deleted.
 * @see {ArchitecturalDirective} Implement a Zero-Trust Security Model with a Centralized Auth Gateway
