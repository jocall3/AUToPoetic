/**
 * @file This module provides utilities for parsing and analyzing bundler statistics files.
 * @module services/profiling/bundleAnalyzer
 *
 * @description
 * In line with architectural directives, all heavy parsing operations within this module
 * are designed to be offloaded to a dedicated Web Worker pool managed by the
 * `workerPoolManager`. This ensures that parsing large stats files does not block
 * the main UI thread, maintaining application responsiveness. The service provides
 * a unified interface for parsing stats from various bundlers like Vite, Webpack, and Rollup.
 *
 * @see ../infrastructure/workerPoolManager - The manager for offloading tasks to Web Workers.
 * @see ../../components/features/PerformanceProfiler.tsx - A consumer of this service.
 */

// NOTE: The workerPoolManager is a central service for offloading heavy tasks.
// Its implementation would handle the creation, management, and communication
// with a pool of Web Workers. This import path assumes the new service architecture.

/**
 * @interface BundleStatsNode
 * @description Represents a node in a hierarchical structure of bundle statistics,
 * typically representing a file, chunk, or module. This structure is suitable for
 * consumption by tree-map or sunburst visualization components.
 *
 * @property {string} name - The name of the node (e.g., file path, chunk name).
 * @property {number} value - The size of the node in bytes. This is the primary metric for visualization.
 * @property {BundleStatsNode[]} [children] - An optional array of child nodes, representing the contents of a directory or the modules within a chunk.

/**
 * Asynchronously parses a Vite `stats.json` file content into a hierarchical `BundleStatsNode` structure.
 * This heavy parsing operation is offloaded to a Web Worker to prevent blocking the main thread.
 *
 * @param {string} statsJson - The raw string content of the `stats.json` file generated by Vite.
 * @returns {Promise<BundleStatsNode>} A promise that resolves with the root `BundleStatsNode` of the parsed statistics tree.
 *
 * @throws {Error} Throws an error if the `workerPoolManager` fails to execute the task or if the JSON is malformed and fails parsing within the worker.
 *
 * @example
 * // In an async function within a React component:
 * const handleFileContent = async (fileContent: string) => {
 *   try {
 *     const statsTree = await parseViteStats(fileContent);
 *     setVisualizationData(statsTree);
 *   } catch (error) {
 *     console.error("Failed to parse Vite stats:", error);
 *     showError("Invalid stats file format.");
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * @performance
 * The entire JSON parsing and tree-building logic is executed in a separate Web Worker thread.
 * This is critical for performance as `stats.json` files can be several megabytes in size.
 * The main thread only sends the JSON string to the worker and awaits the structured result,
 * remaining responsive to user input throughout the process.
 *
 * @security
 * The input `statsJson` is treated as untrusted data. By processing it within a sandboxed
 * Web Worker, we mitigate risks associated with parsing potentially malicious or malformed JSON
 * that could otherwise lead to main-thread crashes or vulnerabilities. The `workerPoolManager`
 * is expected to handle data serialization and deserialization safely.
